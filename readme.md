# Omnifood-Learn-CSS

A fully responsive webpage using CSS Flexbox demonstrating a Food Delivery website.

This webpage was created based on the course "Design and Develop a Killer Website Using HTML5 and CSS3" by Jonas Schmedtmann. Contrary to Original course I have used CSS Flexbox to align content and achive same Look and Feel.

**Happy Learning !!!.**
